### Error handling

#### What does 'fail fast' mean in terms of exception handling? Why is it a good practice?
In unit testing there are positive and negative tests to keep you code well structured  and organized. Fail test means that you test a method with invalid input and the result should throw exception like `IllegalArgumentException` to test what you code supposed to do with wrong input.
